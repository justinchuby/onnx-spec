attributes:
- default_value: NOTSET
  description: auto_pad must be either NOTSET, SAME_UPPER, SAME_LOWER or VALID. Where
    default value is NOTSET, which means explicit padding is used. SAME_UPPER or SAME_LOWER
    mean pad the input so that the output spatial size match the input.In case of
    odd number add the extra padding at the end for SAME_UPPER and at the beginning
    for SAME_LOWER. VALID mean no padding.

  description: Padding for the beginning and ending along each spatial axis, it can
    take any value greater than or equal to 0. The value represent the number of pixels
    added to the beginning and end part of the corresponding axis. `pads` format should
    be as follow [x1_begin, x2_begin...x1_end, x2_end,...], where xi_begin the number
    of pixels added at the beginning of axis `i` and xi_end, the number of pixels
    added at the end of axis `i`. This attribute cannot be used simultaneously with
    auto_pad attribute. If not present, the padding defaults to 0 along start and
    end of each spatial axis.
