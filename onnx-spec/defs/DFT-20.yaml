  description: If `onesided` is `1` and input is real, only values for `k` in `[0,
    1, 2, ..., floor(n_fft/2) + 1]` are returned because the real-to-complex Fourier
    transform satisfies the conjugate symmetry, i.e., `X[m, k] = X[m, n_fft-k]*`,
    where `m` denotes "all other dimensions" DFT was not applied on. If the input
    tensor is complex, onesided output is not possible. Value can be `0` or `1`. Default
    is `0`.

doc: 'Computes the discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the input.


  Assuming the input has shape `[M, N]`, where `N` is the dimension over which the

  DFT is computed and `M` denotes the conceptual "all other dimensions,"

  the DFT `y[m, k]` of shape `[M, N]` is defined as


  $$y[m, k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} e^{-2 \pi j \frac{k n}{N} } x[m, n] ,$$


  and the inverse transform is defined as


  $$x[m, n] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} e^{2 \pi j \frac{k n}{N} } y[m, k] ,$$


  where $j$ is the imaginary unit.


  The actual shape of the output is specified in the "output" section.
