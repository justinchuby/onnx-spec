  Reshape the input tensor similar to numpy.reshape.

  It takes a tensor as input and an argument `shape`. It outputs the reshaped tensor.

  At most one dimension of the new shape can be -1. In this case, the value is

  inferred from the size of the tensor and the remaining dimensions. A dimension

  could also be 0, in which case the actual dimension value is unchanged (i.e. taken

  from the input tensor). Shape (second input) could be an empty shape, which means
  converting to a scalar.

  The input tensor''s shape and the output tensor''s shape are required to have the
  same number of elements.'
