  Computes the product of the input tensor''s element along the provided axes. The
  resulting

  tensor has the same rank as the input if keepdims equals 1. If keepdims equal 0,
  then

  the resulted tensor have the reduced dimension pruned.


  The above behavior is similar to numpy, with the exception that numpy defaults keepdims
  to

  False instead of True.'
