doc: "\nScatterElements takes three inputs `data`, `updates`, and `indices` of the\
  \ same\nrank r >= 1 and an optional attribute axis that identifies an axis of `data`\n\
  (by default, the outer-most axis, that is axis 0). The output of the operation\n\
  is produced by creating a copy of the input `data`, and then updating its value\n\
  to values specified by `updates` at specific index positions specified by\n`indices`.\
  \ Its output shape is the same as the shape of `data`.\n\nFor each entry in `updates`,\
  \ the target index in `data` is obtained by combining\nthe corresponding entry in\
  \ `indices` with the index of the entry itself: the\nindex-value for dimension =\
  \ axis is obtained from the value of the corresponding\nentry in `indices` and the\
  \ index-value for dimension != axis is obtained from the\nindex of the entry itself.\n\
  \nFor instance, in a 2-D tensor case, the update corresponding to the [i][j] entry\n\
  is performed as below:\n```\n  output[indices[i][j]][j] = updates[i][j] if axis\
  \ = 0,\n  output[i][indices[i][j]] = updates[i][j] if axis = 1,\n```\n\nThis operator\
  \ is the inverse of GatherElements. It is similar to Torch's Scatter operation.\n\
  \nExample 1:\n```\n  data = [\n      [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n      [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n\
  \      [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n  ]\n  indices = [\n      [1, 0, 2],\n      [0, 2, 1],\n\
  \  ]\n  updates = [\n      [1.0, 1.1, 1.2],\n      [2.0, 2.1, 2.2],\n  ]\n  output\
  \ = [\n      [2.0, 1.1, 0.0]\n      [1.0, 0.0, 2.2]\n      [0.0, 2.1, 1.2]\n  ]\n\
  ```\nExample 2:\n```\n  data = [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]]\n  indices = [[1, 3]]\n\
  \  updates = [[1.1, 2.1]]\n  axis = 1\n  output = [[1.0, 1.1, 3.0, 2.1, 5.0]]\n\
  ```\n"
