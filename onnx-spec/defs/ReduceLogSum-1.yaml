  Computes the log sum of the input tensor''s element along the provided axes. The
  resulting

  tensor has the same rank as the input if keepdims equals 1. If keepdims equal 0,
  then

  the resulted tensor have the reduced dimension pruned. Input tensors of rank zero
  are

  valid. Reduction over an empty set of values yields minus infinity (if supported
  by the datatype) or undefined otherwise.


  The above behavior is similar to numpy, with the exception that numpy defaults keepdims
  to

  False instead of True.'
