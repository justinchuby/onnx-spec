doc: "\n\nGatherElements takes two inputs `data` and `indices` of the same rank r\
  \ >= 1\nand an optional attribute `axis` that identifies an axis of `data`\n(by\
  \ default, the outer-most axis, that is axis 0). It is an indexing operation\nthat\
  \ produces its output by indexing into the input data tensor at index\npositions\
  \ determined by elements of the `indices` tensor.\nIts output shape is the same\
  \ as the shape of `indices` and consists of one value\n(gathered from the `data`)\
  \ for each element in `indices`.\n\nFor instance, in the 3-D case (r = 3), the output\
  \ produced is determined\nby the following equations:\n```\n  out[i][j][k] = input[index[i][j][k]][j][k]\
  \ if axis = 0,\n  out[i][j][k] = input[i][index[i][j][k]][k] if axis = 1,\n  out[i][j][k]\
  \ = input[i][j][index[i][j][k]] if axis = 2,\n```\n\nThis operator is also the inverse\
  \ of ScatterElements. It is similar to Torch's gather operation.\n\nExample 1:\n\
  ```\n  data = [\n      [1, 2],\n      [3, 4],\n  ]\n  indices = [\n      [0, 0],\n\
  \      [1, 0],\n  ]\n  axis = 1\n  output = [\n      [\n        [1, 1],\n      \
  \  [4, 3],\n      ],\n  ]\n```\nExample 2:\n```\n  data = [\n      [1, 2, 3],\n\
  \      [4, 5, 6],\n      [7, 8, 9],\n  ]\n  indices = [\n      [1, 2, 0],\n    \
  \  [2, 0, 0],\n  ]\n  axis = 0\n  output = [\n      [\n        [4, 8, 3],\n    \
  \    [7, 2, 3],\n      ],\n  ]\n```\n"
