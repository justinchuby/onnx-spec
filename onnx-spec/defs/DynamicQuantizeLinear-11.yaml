  A Function to fuse calculation for Scale, Zero Point and FP32->8Bit conversion of
  FP32 Input data.

  Outputs Scale, ZeroPoint and Quantized Input for a given FP32 Input.

  Scale is calculated as:

  ```

  y_scale = (maximum(0, max(x)) - minimum(0, min(x))) / (qmax - qmin)

  ```


  * where qmax and qmin are max and min values for quantization range i.e. [0, 255]
  in case of uint8

  * data range is adjusted to include 0.


  Zero point is calculated as:

  ```

  intermediate_zero_point = qmin - min(x)/y_scale

  y_zero_point = cast(round(saturate(itermediate_zero_point)))

  ```


  * where qmax and qmin are max and min values for quantization range .i.e [0, 255]
  in case of uint8

  * for saturation, it saturates to [0, 255] if it''s uint8, or [-127, 127] if it''s
  int8. Right now only uint8 is supported.

  * rounding to nearest ties to even.


  Data quantization formula is:

  ```

  y = saturate (round (x / y_scale) + y_zero_point)

  ```


  * for saturation, it saturates to [0, 255] if it''s uint8, or [-127, 127] if it''s
  int8. Right now only uint8 is supported.

  * rounding to nearest ties to even.
