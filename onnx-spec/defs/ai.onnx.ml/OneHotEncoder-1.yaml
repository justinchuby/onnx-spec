  Replace each input element with an array of ones and zeros, where a single
  one is placed at the index of the category that was passed in. The total category count
  will determine the size of the extra dimension of the output array Y.

  For example, if we pass a tensor with a single value of 4, and a category count of 8,
  the output will be a tensor with ``[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]``.

  This operator assumes every input feature is from the same set of categories.

  If the input is a tensor of float, int32, or double, the data will be cast
  to integers and the cats_int64s category list will be used for the lookups.
