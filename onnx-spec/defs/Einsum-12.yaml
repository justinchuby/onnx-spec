  An einsum of the form `term1, term2 -> output-term` produces an output tensor using
  the following equation


  ```

  output[output-term] = reduce-sum( input1[term1] * input2[term2] )

  ```


  where the reduce-sum performs a summation over all the indices occurring in the
  input terms (term1, term2)

  that do not occur in the output-term.


  The Einsum operator evaluates algebraic tensor operations on a sequence of tensors,
  using the Einstein summation

  convention. The equation string contains a comma-separated sequence of lower case
  letters. Each term corresponds to

  an operand tensor, and the characters within the terms correspond to operands dimensions.


  This sequence may be followed by "->" to separate the left and right hand side of
  the equation.

  If the equation contains "->" followed by the right-hand side, the explicit (not
  classical) form of the Einstein

  summation is performed, and the right-hand side indices indicate output tensor dimensions.
  In other cases,

  output indices are (implicitly) set to the alphabetically sorted sequence of indices
  appearing exactly once in the

  equation.


  When a dimension character is repeated in the left-hand side, it represents summation
  along the dimension.


  The equation may contain ellipsis ("...") to enable broadcasting. Ellipsis must
  indicate a fixed number of dimensions.

  Specifically, every occurrence of ellipsis in the equation must represent the same
  number of dimensions.

  The right-hand side may contain exactly one ellipsis. In implicit mode, the ellipsis
  dimensions are set to the

  beginning of the output. The equation string may contain space (U+0020) character.
