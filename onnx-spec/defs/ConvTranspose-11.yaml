attributes:
- name: auto_pad
  description: auto_pad must be either NOTSET, SAME_UPPER, SAME_LOWER or VALID. Where
    default value is NOTSET, which means explicit padding is used. SAME_UPPER or SAME_LOWER
    mean pad the input so that `output_shape[i] = input_shape[i] * strides[i]` for
    each axis `i`. The padding is split between the two sides equally or almost equally
    (depending on whether it is even or odd). In case the padding is an odd number,
    the extra padding is added at the end for SAME_UPPER and at the beginning for
    SAME_LOWER.

- name: dilations
  description: dilation value along each spatial axis of the filter. If not present,
    the dilation defaults to 1 along each spatial axis.

- name: output_padding
  description: Additional elements added to the side with higher coordinate indices
    in the output. Each padding value in "output_padding" must be less than the corresponding
    stride/dilation dimension. By default, this attribute is a zero vector. Note that
    this attribute doesn't directly affect the computed output values. It only controls
    the selection of the computed values, so changing this attribute only adds or
    removes output elements. If "output_shape" is explicitly provided, "output_padding"
    does not contribute additional size to "output_shape" but participates in the
    computation of the needed padding amount. This is also called adjs or adjustment
    in some frameworks.
  type: AttrType.INTS
  required: false
  default_value: null
- name: output_shape
  description: The shape of the output can be explicitly set which will cause pads
    values to be auto generated. If output_shape is specified pads values are ignored.
    See doc for details for equations to generate pads. Note that the output_shape
    attribute value should not include dimensions for batch size and channels, which
    are automatically inferred.

- name: pads
  description: Padding for the beginning and ending along each spatial axis, it can
    take any value greater than or equal to 0. The value represent the number of pixels
    added to the beginning and end part of the corresponding axis. `pads` format should
    be as follow [x1_begin, x2_begin...x1_end, x2_end,...], where xi_begin the number
    of pixels added at the beginning of axis `i` and xi_end, the number of pixels
    added at the end of axis `i`. This attribute cannot be used simultaneously with
    auto_pad attribute. If not present, the padding defaults to 0 along start and
    end of each spatial axis.

  description: The weight tensor that will be used in the convolutions; has size (C

    than 2 dimensions, the weight shape will be (C x M/group x k1 x k2 x ... x kn),
    where (k1 x k2 x ... x kn) is the dimension of the kernel. The number of channels
    in the output should be equal to W.shape[1] * group (assuming zero based indices
    of the shape array)
