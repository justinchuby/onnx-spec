  The linear quantization operator. It consumes a high precision tensor, a scale,
  and a zero point to compute the low precision / quantized tensor.

  The scale factor and zero point must have same shape, and can be either a scalar
  for per-tensor / per layer quantization, or a 1-D tensor for per-axis quantization.

  The quantization formula is `y = saturate ((x / y_scale) + y_zero_point)`.

  For saturation, it saturates to [0, 255] if it''s uint8, or [-128, 127] if it''s
  int8.

  For (x / y_scale), it''s rounding to the nearest even. Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding
  for details.

  ''y_zero_point'' and ''y'' must have same type.

  ''y_zero_point'' is usually not used for quantization to float8e4m3fn, float8e4m3fnuz,
  float8e5m2, float8e5m2fnuz,

  but the quantization formula remains the same for consistency and

  the type of the attribute ''y_zero_point'' still determines the quantization type.

attributes:
- name: axis
  description: (Optional) The axis of the quantization dimension of the input tensor.
    Ignored for per-tensor quantization. Negative value means counting dimensions
    from the back. Accepted range is [-r, r-1] where r = rank(input).
  type: AttrType.INT
  required: false
  default_value: 1
- name: saturate
  description: The parameter defines how the conversion behaves if an input value
    is out of range of the destination type. It only applies for float 8 quantization
    (float8e4m3fn, float8e4m3fnuz, float8e5m2, float8e5m2fnuz). It is true by default.
    All cases are fully described in two tables inserted in the operator description.
