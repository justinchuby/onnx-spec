  description: Values that are live-out to the enclosing scope. The return values
    in the `then_branch` and `else_branch` must be of the same data type. The `then_branch`
    and `else_branch` may produce tensors with the same element type and different
    shapes. If corresponding outputs from the then-branch and the else-branch have
    static shapes S1 and S2, then the shape of the corresponding output variable of
    the if-node (if present) must be compatible with both S1 and S2 as it represents
    the union of both possible shapes.For example, if in a model file, the first output
    of `then_branch` is typed float tensor with shape [2] and the first output of
    `else_branch` is another float tensor with shape [3], If's first output should
    have (a) no shape set, or (b) a shape of rank 1 with neither `dim_value` nor `dim_param`
    set, or (c) a shape of rank 1 with a unique `dim_param`. In contrast, the first
    output cannot have the shape [2] since [2] and [3] are not compatible.
