    split is included in the output.

doc: 'StringSplit splits a string tensor''s elements into substrings based on a delimiter
  attribute and a maxsplit attribute.


  The first output of this operator is a tensor of strings representing the substrings
  from splitting each input string on the `delimiter` substring. This tensor has one
  additional rank compared to the input tensor in order to store the substrings for
  each input element (where the input tensor is not empty). Note that, in order to
  ensure the same number of elements are present in the final dimension, this tensor
  will pad empty strings as illustrated in the examples below. Consecutive delimiters
  are not grouped together and are deemed to delimit empty strings, except if the
  `delimiter` is unspecified or is the empty string (""). In the case where the `delimiter`
  is unspecified or the empty string, consecutive whitespace characters are regarded
  as a single separator and leading or trailing whitespace is removed in the output.


  The second output tensor represents the number of substrings generated. `maxsplit`
  can be used to limit the number of splits performed - after the `maxsplit`th split
  if the string is not fully split, the trailing suffix of input string after the
  final split point is also added. For elements where fewer splits are possible than
  specified in `maxsplit`, it has no effect.'
