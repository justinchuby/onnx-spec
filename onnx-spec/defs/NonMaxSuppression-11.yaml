  description: Integer indicate the format of the box data. The default is 0. 0 -
    the box data is supplied as [y1, x1, y2, x2] where (y1, x1) and (y2, x2) are the
    coordinates of any diagonal pair of box corners and the coordinates can be provided
    as normalized (i.e., lying in the interval [0, 1]) or absolute. Mostly used for
    TF models. 1 - the box data is supplied as [x_center, y_center, width, height].
    Mostly used for Pytorch models.

  Filter out boxes that have high intersection-over-union (IOU) overlap with previously
  selected boxes.

  Bounding boxes with score less than score_threshold are removed. Bounding box format
  is indicated by attribute center_point_box.

  Note that this algorithm is agnostic to where the origin is in the coordinate system
  and more generally is invariant to

  orthogonal transformations and translations of the coordinate system; thus translating
  or reflections of the coordinate system

  result in the same boxes being selected by the algorithm.

  The selected_indices output is a set of integers indexing into the input collection
  of bounding boxes representing the selected boxes.

  The bounding box coordinates corresponding to the selected indices can then be obtained
  using the Gather or GatherND operation.
