  Round takes one input Tensor and rounds the values, element-wise, meaning

  it finds the nearest integer for each value.

  In case of halves, the rule is to round them to the nearest even integer.

  If input x is integral, +0, -0, NaN,  or infinite, x itself is returned.

  The output tensor has the same shape and type as the input.


  Examples:

  ```

  round([0.9]) = [1.0]

  round([2.5]) = [2.0]

  round([2.3]) = [2.0]

  round([1.5]) = [2.0]

  round([-4.5]) = [-4.0]

  ```
