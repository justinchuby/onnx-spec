  Round takes one input Tensor and rounds the values, element-wise, meaning
  it finds the nearest integer for each value.
  In case of halves, the rule is to round them to the nearest even integer.
  If input x is integral, +0, -0, NaN,  or infinite, x itself is returned.
  The output tensor has the same shape and type as the input.

  Examples:
  ```
  round([0.9]) = [1.0]
  round([2.5]) = [2.0]
  round([2.3]) = [2.0]
  round([1.5]) = [2.0]
  round([-4.5]) = [-4.0]
  ```
