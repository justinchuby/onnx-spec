  description: Defines behavior if 'axes' is empty. Default behavior with 'false'
    is to reduce all axes. When axes is empty and this attribute is set to true, input
    tensor will not be reduced,and the output tensor would be equivalent to input
    tensor.

doc: '

  Computes the sum square of the input tensor''s elements along the provided axes.
  The resulting

  tensor has the same rank as the input if `keepdims` equals 1. If `keepdims` equals
  0, then

  the resulting tensor has the reduced dimension pruned. Input tensors of rank zero
  are

  valid. Reduction over an empty set of values yields 0.



  The above behavior is similar to numpy, with the exception that numpy defaults `keepdims`

  to `False` instead of `True`.'
