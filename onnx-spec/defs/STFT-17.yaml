  description: If onesided is 1, only values for w in [0, 1, 2, ..., floor(n_fft/2)
    + 1] are returned because the real-to-complex Fourier transform satisfies the
    conjugate symmetry, i.e., X[m, w] = X[m,w]=X[m,n_fft-w]*. Note if the input or
    window tensors are complex, then onesided output is not possible. Enabling onesided
    with real inputs performs a Real-valued fast Fourier transform (RFFT).When invoked
    with real or complex valued input, the default value is 1. Values can be 0 or
    1.
