  The linear dequantization operator. It consumes a quantized tensor, a scale, a zero
  point to compute the full precision tensor.

  The dequantization formula is y = (x - x_zero_point) * x_scale. ''x_scale'' and
  ''x_zero_point'' are both scalars.

  ''x_zero_point'' and ''x'' must have same type. ''x'' and ''y'' must have same shape.
  In the case of dequantizing int32,

  there''s no zero point (zero point is supposed to be 0).
