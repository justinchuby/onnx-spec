inputs:
- description: Input data tensor from the previous operator; dimensions for image
    case are (N x C x H x W), where N is the batch size, C is the number of channels,
    and H and W are the height and the width of the data. For non image case, the
    dimension are in the form of (N x C x D1 x D2 ... Dn), where N is the batch size.
