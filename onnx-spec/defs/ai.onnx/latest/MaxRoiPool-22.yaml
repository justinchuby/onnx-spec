  ROI max pool consumes an input tensor X and region of interests (RoIs) to
  apply max pooling across each RoI, to produce output 4-D tensor of shape
  (num_rois, channels, pooled_shape[0], pooled_shape[1]).
attributes:
  - name: spatial_scale
    description: >-
      Multiplicative spatial scale factor to translate ROI coordinates from their
      input scale to the scale used when pooling.

    description: >-
      ROI pool output shape (height, width).

inputs:
  - name: X
    type_str: T
    description: Input data tensor from the previous operator; dimensions for 
      image case are (N x C x H x W), where N is the batch size, C is the number
      of channels, and H and W are the height and the width of the data.
