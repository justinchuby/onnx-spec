  AveragePool consumes an input tensor X and applies average pooling across
  the tensor according to kernel sizes, stride sizes, and pad lengths.
  average pooling consisting of computing the average on all values of a
  subset of the input tensor according to the kernel size and downsampling the
  data into the output tensor Y for further processing. The output spatial shape is calculated differently
  depending on whether explicit padding is used, where pads is employed, or auto padding is used, where auto_pad is utilized.
  With explicit padding (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MaxPool2d.html?highlight=maxpool#torch.nn.MaxPool2d):
  ```
  output_spatial_shape[i] = floor((input_spatial_shape[i] + pad_shape[i] - dilation[i] * (kernel_shape[i] - 1) - 1) / strides_spatial_shape[i] + 1)
  ```
  or
  ```
  output_spatial_shape[i] = ceil((input_spatial_shape[i] + pad_shape[i] - dilation[i] * (kernel_shape[i] - 1) - 1) / strides_spatial_shape[i] + 1)
  ```
  if ceil_mode is enabled. `pad_shape[i]` is the sum of pads along axis `i`.

  `auto_pad` is a DEPRECATED attribute. If you are using them currently, the output spatial shape will be following when ceil_mode is enabled:
  ```
  VALID: output_spatial_shape[i] = ceil((input_spatial_shape[i] - ((kernel_spatial_shape[i] - 1) * dilations[i] + 1) + 1) / strides_spatial_shape[i])
  SAME_UPPER or SAME_LOWER: output_spatial_shape[i] = ceil(input_spatial_shape[i] / strides_spatial_shape[i])
  ```
  or when ceil_mode is disabled (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/AveragePooling2D):
  ```
  VALID: output_spatial_shape[i] = floor((input_spatial_shape[i] - ((kernel_spatial_shape[i] - 1) * dilations[i] + 1)) / strides_spatial_shape[i]) + 1
  SAME_UPPER or SAME_LOWER: output_spatial_shape[i] = floor((input_spatial_shape[i] - 1) / strides_spatial_shape[i]) + 1
  ```
  And pad shape will be following if `SAME_UPPER` or `SAME_LOWER`:
  ```
  pad_shape[i] = (output_spatial_shape[i] - 1) * strides_spatial_shape[i] + ((kernel_spatial_shape[i] - 1) * dilations[i] + 1) - input_spatial_shape[i]
  ```
  The output of each pooling window is divided by the number of elements (exclude pad when attribute count_include_pad is zero).
attributes:
  - name: auto_pad
    description: auto_pad must be either NOTSET, SAME_UPPER, SAME_LOWER or VALID.
      Where default value is NOTSET, which means explicit padding is used. SAME_UPPER
      or SAME_LOWER mean pad the input so that `output_shape[i] = ceil(input_shape[i]
      / strides[i])` for each axis `i`. The padding is split between the two sides
      equally or almost equally (depending on whether it is even or odd). In case
      the padding is an odd number, the extra padding is added at the end for SAME_UPPER
      and at the beginning for SAME_LOWER.
