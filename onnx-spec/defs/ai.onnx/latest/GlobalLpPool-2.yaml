  GlobalLpPool consumes an input tensor X and applies lp pool pooling across
  the values in the same channel. This is equivalent to LpPool with kernel size
  equal to the spatial dimension of input tensor.

    description: Input data tensor from the previous operator; dimensions for image
      case are (N x C x H x W), where N is the batch size, C is the number of channels,
      and H and W are the height and the width of the data. For non image case, the
      dimensions are in the form of (N x C x D1 x D2 ... Dn), where N is the batch
      size.

    description: Output data tensor from pooling across the input tensor. The output
      tensor has the same rank as the input. The first two dimensions of output shape
      are the same as the input (N x C), while the other dimensions are all 1.
