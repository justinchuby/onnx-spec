  Computes the log sum of the input tensor's elements along the provided axes. The resulting
  tensor has the same rank as the input if `keepdims` equals 1. If `keepdims` equals 0, then
  the resulting tensor has the reduced dimension pruned. Input tensors of rank zero are
  valid. Reduction over an empty set of values yields minus infinity (if supported by the datatype) or undefined otherwise.


  The above behavior is similar to numpy, with the exception that numpy defaults `keepdims`
  to `False` instead of `True`.

    description: >-
      Defines behavior when axes is not provided or is empty. If false (default),
      reduction happens over all axes. If true, no reduction is applied, but other
      operations will be performed. For example, ReduceSumSquare acts as a vanilla
      Square.

    description: "Optional input list of integers, along which to reduce. The default
      is to reduce over empty axes. When axes is empty (either not provided or explicitly
      empty), behavior depends on 'noop_with_empty_axes': reduction over all axes
      if 'noop_with_empty_axes' is false, or no reduction is applied if 'noop_with_empty_axes'
      is true (but other operations will be performed). Accepted range is [-r, r-1]
      where r = rank(data)."
