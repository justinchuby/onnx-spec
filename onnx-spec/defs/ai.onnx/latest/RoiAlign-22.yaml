  Region of Interest (RoI) align operation described in the
  [Mask R-CNN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870).
  RoiAlign consumes an input tensor X and region of interests (rois)
  to apply pooling across each RoI; it produces a 4-D tensor of shape
  (num_rois, C, output_height, output_width).

  RoiAlign is proposed to avoid the misalignment by removing
  quantizations while converting from original image into feature
  map and from feature map into RoI feature; in each ROI bin,
  the value of the sampled locations are computed directly
  through bilinear interpolation.
attributes:

    description: >-
      Allowed values are 'half_pixel' and 'output_half_pixel'. Use the value 'half_pixel'
      to pixel shift the input coordinates by -0.5 (the recommended behavior). Use
      the value 'output_half_pixel' to omit the pixel shift for the input (use this
      for a backward-compatible behavior).

  - name: sampling_ratio
    description: >-
      Number of sampling points in the interpolation grid used to compute the output
      value of each pooled output bin. If > 0, then exactly sampling_ratio x sampling_ratio
      grid points are used. If == 0, then an adaptive number of grid points are used
      (computed as ceil(roi_width / output_width), and likewise for height). Default
      is 0.

      Multiplicative spatial scale factor to translate ROI coordinates from their
      input spatial scale to the scale used when pooling, i.e., spatial scale of the
      input feature map X relative to the input image. E.g.; default is 1.0f.
