  Generate a tensor of samples from a multinomial distribution according to the probabilities
  of each of the possible outcomes.
attributes:
  - name: dtype
    description: >-
      (Optional) The data type for the elements of the output tensor, if not specified,
      we will use int32.
    type: INT
    required: false
    default_value: 6
  - name: seed
    description: >-
      (Optional) Seed to the random generator, if not specified we will auto generate
      one.
    type: FLOAT
    required: false
  - name: sample_size
    description: >-
      Number of times to sample.
    type: INT

    description: Input tensor with shape [batch_size, class_size], where 
      class_size is the number of all possible outcomes. Each value along the 
      axis zero represents the unnormalized log-probability of each 
      corresponding outcome in a batch.

    description: Output tensor with shape [batch_size, sample_size], where 
      sample_size is the number of times to sample. Each value along the axis 
      zero represents the outcome of the corresponding sample in a batch.
