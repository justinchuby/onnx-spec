  A GroupNormalization function. Carries out group normalization as described in
  the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08494

  This operator transforms input according to
  ```
  y = scale * (x - mean) / sqrt(variance + epsilon) + bias,
  ```
  where the mean and variance are computed per instance per group of channels, and
  `scale` and `bias` should be specified for each channel. The number of
  groups `num_groups` should be divisible by the number of channels so that there are
  an equal number of channels per group.

  The overall computation has two stages: the first stage normalizes the elements to
  have zero mean and unit variance for each instance in each group, and the second
  stage scales and shifts the results of the first stage. The floating-point precision
  used in the first stage is determined by the `stash_type` attribute. For example,
  if `stash_type` is 1, the operator casts all input variables to 32-bit float,
  performs the computation, and finally casts the normalized results back to the
  original type of `X`. The second stage does not depend on `stash_type`.

  When the number of groups is the same as the number of channels, this operator is
  equivalent to InstanceNormalization. When there is only one group, this operator
  is equivalent to LayerNormalization.

    description: Input data tensor. Dimensions for image cases are `(N x C x H x
      W)`, where `N` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` 
      and `W` are the height and width of the data. Statistics are computed for 
      every group of channels over `C`, `H`, and `W`. For non-image cases, the 
      dimensions are in the form of `(N x C x D1 x D2 ... Dn)`.
