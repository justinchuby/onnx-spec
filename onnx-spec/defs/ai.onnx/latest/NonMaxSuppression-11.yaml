  Filter out boxes that have high intersection-over-union (IOU) overlap with previously selected boxes.
  Bounding boxes with score less than score_threshold are removed. Bounding box format is indicated by attribute center_point_box.
  Note that this algorithm is agnostic to where the origin is in the coordinate system and more generally is invariant to
  orthogonal transformations and translations of the coordinate system; thus translating or reflections of the coordinate system
  result in the same boxes being selected by the algorithm.
  The selected_indices output is a set of integers indexing into the input collection of bounding boxes representing the selected boxes.
  The bounding box coordinates corresponding to the selected indices can then be obtained using the Gather or GatherND operation.

    description: >-
      Integer indicate the format of the box data. The default is 0. 0 - the box data
      is supplied as [y1, x1, y2, x2] where (y1, x1) and (y2, x2) are the coordinates
      of any diagonal pair of box corners and the coordinates can be provided as normalized
      (i.e., lying in the interval [0, 1]) or absolute. Mostly used for TF models.
      1 - the box data is supplied as [x_center, y_center, width, height]. Mostly
      used for Pytorch models.
