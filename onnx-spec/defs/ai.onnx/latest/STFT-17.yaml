  Computes the Short-time Fourier Transform of the signal.
attributes:
  - name: onesided
    description: >-
      If onesided is 1, only values for w in [0, 1, 2, ..., floor(n_fft/2) + 1] are
      returned because the real-to-complex Fourier transform satisfies the conjugate
      symmetry, i.e., X[m, w] = X[m,w]=X[m,n_fft-w]*. Note if the input or window
      tensors are complex, then onesided output is not possible. Enabling onesided
      with real inputs performs a Real-valued fast Fourier transform (RFFT).When invoked
      with real or complex valued input, the default value is 1. Values can be 0 or
      1.
