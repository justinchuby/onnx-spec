  Selects slices from an input tensor along a given axis where condition evaluates to True for each axis index.
  In case axis is not provided, input is flattened before elements are selected.
  Compress behaves like numpy.compress: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.compress.html

    description: >-
      (Optional) Axis along which to take slices. If not specified, input is flattened
      before elements being selected. Negative value means counting dimensions from
      the back. Accepted range is [-r, r-1] where r = rank(input).

    description: Rank 1 tensor of booleans to indicate which slices or data elements
      to be selected. Its length can be less than the input length along the axis
      or the flattened input size if axis is not specified. In such cases data slices
      or elements exceeding the condition length are discarded.
