  The linear quantization operator. It consumes a high precision tensor, a scale, and a zero point to compute the low precision / quantized tensor.
  The scale factor and zero point must have same shape, and can be either a scalar for per-tensor / per layer quantization, or a 1-D tensor for per-axis quantization.
  The quantization formula is y = saturate ((x / y_scale) + y_zero_point).
  For saturation, it saturates to [0, 255] if it's uint8, or [-128, 127] if it's int8.
  For (x / y_scale), it's rounding to the nearest even. Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding for details. 'y_zero_point' and 'y' must have same type.

    description: >-
      (Optional) The axis of the quantization dimension of the input tensor. Ignored
      for per-tensor quantization. Negative value means counting dimensions from the
      back. Accepted range is [-r, r-1] where r = rank(input).
