  Pow takes input data (Tensor<T>) and exponent Tensor, and
  produces one output data (Tensor<T>) where the function `f(x) = x^exponent`,
  is applied to the data tensor elementwise.

  If necessary the right-hand-side argument will be broadcasted to match the
  shape of left-hand-side argument. When broadcasting is specified, the second
  tensor can either be of element size 1 (including a scalar tensor and any
  tensor with rank equal to or smaller than the first tensor), or having its
  shape as a contiguous subset of the first tensor's shape. The starting of the
  mutually equal shape is specified by the argument "axis", and if it is not set,
  suffix matching is assumed. 1-dim expansion doesn't work yet.

  For example, the following tensor shapes are supported (with broadcast=1):

    shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (,), i.e. B is a scalar tensor
    shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (1, 1), i.e. B is an 1-element tensor
    shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (5,)
    shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (4, 5)
    shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (3, 4), with axis=1
    shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (2), with axis=0

  Attribute `broadcast=1` needs to be passed to enable broadcasting.
