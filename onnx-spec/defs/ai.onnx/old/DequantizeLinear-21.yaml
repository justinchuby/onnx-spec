  The linear dequantization operator. It consumes a quantized tensor, a scale, and a zero point to compute the
  full-precision tensor. The dequantization formula is `y = (x - x_zero_point) * x_scale`. `x_scale` and `x_zero_point`
  must have the same shape, determining the quantization's granularity: a scalar for per-tensor/per-layer quantization,
  a 1-D tensor for per-axis quantization, or have a rank identical to the input for blocked quantization.
  See QuantizeLinear for details on quantization granularity.
  `x_zero_point` and `x` must have the same type. `x` and `y` must have the same shape. In the case of dequantizing
  `int32`, there's no zero point (zero point is supposed to be 0).
  `zero-point` is usually not used in the case of float8 types quantization, but the dequantization formula remains the same
  for consistency, and `x_scale` still determines the output type.
attributes:
  - name: block_size
    description: >-
      (Optional) The size of the quantization block (number of times every scale is
      replicated). Used only for blocked quantization. The block size is a positive
      integer. Given `x` shape `(D0, ..., Di, ..., Dn)`, `y_scale` shape `(S0, ...
      Si, ...Sn)` and `axis=i`, the accepted range is `[ceil(Di/Si), ceil(Di/(Si-1))-1]`

    default_value: 0
  - name: axis
    description: >-
      (Optional) The axis of the dequantizing dimension of the input tensor. Used
      for per-axis and blocked quantization. Negative value means counting dimensions
      from the back. Accepted range is `[-r, r-1]` where `r = rank(input)`.

    description: Scale for input `x`. For per-tensor/layer dequantization the 
      scale is a scalar, for per per-axis dequantization it is a 1-D Tensor and 
      for blocked dequantization it has the same shape as the input, except for 
      one dimension in which blocking is performed.
