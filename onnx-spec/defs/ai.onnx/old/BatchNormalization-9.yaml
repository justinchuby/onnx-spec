  Carries out batch normalization as described in the paper
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167. Depending on the mode it is being run,
  there are multiple cases for the number of outputs, which we list below:

  Output case #1: Y, mean, var, saved_mean, saved_var (training mode)
  Output case #2: Y (test mode)

  For previous (depreciated) non-spatial cases, implementors are suggested
  to flatten the input shape to (N x C*D1*D2 ..*Dn) before a BatchNormalization Op.
  This operator has **optional** inputs/outputs. See [the doc](IR.md) for more details about the representation of optional arguments. An empty string may be used in the place of an actual argument's name to indicate a missing argument. Trailing optional arguments (those not followed by an argument that is present) may also be simply omitted.

    description: Input data tensor from the previous operator; dimensions are in the
      form of (N x C x D1 x D2 ... Dn), where N is the batch size, C is the number
      of channels. Statistics are computed for every channel of C over N and D1 to
      Dn dimensions. For image data, input dimensions become (N x C x H x W). The
      op also accepts single dimension input of size N in which case C is assumed
      to be 1
