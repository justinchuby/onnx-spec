  Flattens the input tensor into a 2D matrix. If input tensor has shape
  (d_0, d_1, ... d_n) then the output will have shape
  (d_0 X d_1 ... d_(axis-1), d_axis X d_(axis+1) ... X dn).
attributes:
  - name: axis
    description: >-
      Indicate up to which input dimensions (exclusive) should be flattened to the
      outer dimension of the output. The value for axis must be in the range [0, R],
      where R is the rank of the input tensor. When axis = 0, the shape of the output
      tensor is (1, (d_0 X d_1 ... d_n), where the shape of the input tensor is (d_0,
      d_1, ... d_n).
