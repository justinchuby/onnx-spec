  PRelu takes input data (Tensor<T>) and slope tensor as input, and produces one
  output data (Tensor<T>) where the function `f(x) = slope * x for x < 0`,
  `f(x) = x for x >= 0`., is applied to the data tensor elementwise.
  This operator supports **unidirectional broadcasting** (tensor slope should be unidirectional broadcastable to input tensor X); for more details please check [the doc](Broadcasting.md).
