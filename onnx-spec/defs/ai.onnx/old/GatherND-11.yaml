  Given `data` tensor of rank `r` >= 1, and `indices` tensor of rank `q` >= 1, this operator gathers
  slices of `data` into an output tensor of rank `q + r - indices_shape[-1] - 1`.

  `indices` is an q-dimensional integer tensor, best thought of as a `(q-1)`-dimensional tensor of index-tuples into `data`,
  where each element defines a slice of `data`

  Some salient points about the inputs' rank and shape:

  1) r >= 1 and q >= 1 are to be honored. There is no dependency condition to be met between ranks `r` and `q`

  2) The `indices_shape[-1]` should have a value between 1 (inclusive) and rank `r` (inclusive)

  3) All values in `indices` are expected to be within bounds [-s, s-1] along axis of size `s` (i.e.) `-data_shape[i] <= indices[...,i] <= data_shape[i] - 1`.
     It is an error if any of the index values are out of bounds.

  The output is computed as follows:

  The output tensor is obtained by mapping each index-tuple in the `indices` tensor to the corresponding slice of the input `data`.

  1) If `indices_shape[-1] > r` => error condition

  2) If `indices_shape[-1] == r`, since the rank of `indices` is `q`, `indices` can be thought of as a `(q-1)`-dimensional tensor
     containing 1-D tensors of dimension `r`. Let us think of each such `r` ranked tensor as `indices_slice`.
     Each *scalar value* corresponding to `data[indices_slice]` is filled into the corresponding location of the `(q-1)`-dimensional tensor
     to form the `output` tensor (Example 1 below)

  3) If `indices_shape[-1] < r`, since the rank of `indices` is `q`, `indices` can be thought of as a `(q-1)`-dimensional tensor
     containing 1-D tensors of dimension `< r`. Let us think of each such tensors as `indices_slice`.
     Each *tensor slice* corresponding to `data[indices_slice , :]` is filled into the corresponding location of the `(q-1)`-dimensional tensor
     to form the `output` tensor (Examples 2, 3, and 4 below)

  This operator is the inverse of `ScatterND`.

  `Example 1`

    data    = [[0,1],[2,3]]   # data_shape = [2, 2]

    indices = [[0,0],[1,1]]   # indices_shape = [2, 2]

    output  = [0,3]           # output_shape = [2]

  `Example 2`

    data    = [[0,1],[2,3]]  # data_shape = [2, 2]

    indices = [[1],[0]]      # indices_shape = [2, 1]

    output  = [[2,3],[0,1]]  # output_shape = [2, 2]

  `Example 3`

    data    = [[[0,1],[2,3]],[[4,5],[6,7]]] # data_shape = [2, 2, 2]

    indices = [[0,1],[1,0]]                 # indices_shape = [2, 2]

    output  = [[2,3],[4,5]]                 # output_shape = [2, 2]

  `Example 4`

    data    = [[[0,1],[2,3]],[[4,5],[6,7]]] # data_shape = [2, 2, 2]

    indices = [[[0,1]],[[1,0]]]             # indices_shape = [2, 1, 2]

    output  = [[[2,3]],[[4,5]]]             # output_shape = [2, 1, 2]
