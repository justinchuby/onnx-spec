  A MeanVarianceNormalization Function: Perform mean variance normalization
  on the input tensor X using formula: <br/> ``` (X-EX)/sqrt(E(X-EX)^2) ```
attributes:
  - name: axes
    description: >-
      A list of integers, along which to reduce. The default is to calculate along
      axes [0,2,3] for calculating mean and variance along each channel. Two variables
      with the same C-coordinate are associated with the same mean and variance.
