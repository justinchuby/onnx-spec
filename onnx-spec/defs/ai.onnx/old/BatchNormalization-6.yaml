  Carries out batch normalization as described in the paper
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167. Depending on the mode it is being run,
  there are multiple cases for the number of outputs, which we list below:

  Output case #1: Y, mean, var, saved_mean, saved_var (training mode)
  Output case #2: Y (test mode)
attributes:
  - name: epsilon
    description: >-
      The epsilon value to use to avoid division by zero, default is 1e-5f.
    type: FLOAT
    required: false
    default_value: 9.999999747378752e-06
  - name: is_test
    description: >-
      If set to nonzero, run spatial batch normalization in test mode, default is
      0.
    type: INT
    required: false
    default_value: 0
  - name: momentum
    description: >-
      Factor used in computing the running mean and variance.e.g., running_mean =
      running_mean * momentum + mean * (1 - momentum), default is 0.9f.
    type: FLOAT
    required: false
    default_value: 0.8999999761581421
  - name: spatial
    description: >-
      If true, compute the mean and variance across all spatial elements If false,
      compute the mean and variance across per feature.Default is 1.
    type: INT
    required: false
    default_value: 1
inputs:
  - name: X
    type_str: T
    description: Input data tensor from the previous operator; dimensions for image
      case are (N x C x H x W), where N is the batch size, C is the number of channels,
      and H and W are the height and the width of the data. For non image case, the
      dimensions are in the form of (N x C x D1 x D2 ... Dn), where N is the batch
      size.
