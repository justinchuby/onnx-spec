  Dropout takes one input floating tensor and produces two tensor outputs,
  output (floating tensor) and mask (`Tensor<bool>`). Depending on whether it is
  in test mode or not, the output Y will either be a random dropout, or a simple
  copy of the input. Note that our implementation of Dropout does scaling in
  the training phase, so during testing nothing needs to be done.
  This operator has **optional** inputs/outputs. See [the doc](IR.md) for more details about the representation of optional arguments. An empty string may be used in the place of an actual argument's name to indicate a missing argument. Trailing optional arguments (those not followed by an argument that is present) may also be simply omitted.
