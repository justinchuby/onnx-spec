  GlobalLpPool consumes an input tensor X and applies lp pool pooling across the
  the values in the same channel. This is equivalent to LpPool with kernel size
  equal to the spatial dimension of input tensor.

    description: Input data tensor from the previous operator; dimensions for image
      case are (N x C x H x W), where N is the batch size, C is the number of channels,
      and H and W are the height and the width of the data. For non image case, the
      dimension are in the form of (N x C x D1 x D2 ... Dn), where N is the batch
      size.
