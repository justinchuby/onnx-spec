  Computes the log sum exponent of the input tensor's element along the provided axes. The resulting
  tensor has the same rank as the input if keepdims equals 1. If keepdims equal 0, then
  the resulted tensor have the reduced dimension pruned.

  The above behavior is similar to numpy, with the exception that numpy defaults keepdims to
  False instead of True.
attributes:

    description: >-
      A list of integers, along which to reduce. The default is to reduce over all
      the dimensions of the input tensor. Accepted range is [-r, r-1] where r = rank(data).
