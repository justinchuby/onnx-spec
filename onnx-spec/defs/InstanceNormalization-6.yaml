  Carries out instance normalization as described in the paper

  https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08022.


  y = scale * (x - mean) / sqrt(variance + epsilon) + B,

  where mean and variance are computed per instance per channel.

  description: Input data tensor from the previous operator; dimensions for image
    case are (N x C x H x W), where N is the batch size, C is the number of channels,
    and H and W are the height and the width of the data. For non image case, the
    dimensions are in the form of (N x C x D1 x D2 ... Dn), where N is the batch size.
