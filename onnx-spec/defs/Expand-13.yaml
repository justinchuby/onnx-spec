  Broadcast the input tensor following the given shape and the broadcast rule.

  The broadcast rule is similar to numpy.array(input) * numpy.ones(shape):

  Dimensions are right alignment;

  Two corresponding dimensions must have the same value, or one of them is equal to
  1.

  Also, this operator is similar to numpy.broadcast_to(input, shape),

  but the major difference is numpy.broadcast_to() does not allow shape to be smaller
  than input.size().

  It is possible that the output.shape is not equal to shape, when some dimensions
  in shape is equal to 1,

  or the shape.ndim < input.shape.ndim.
