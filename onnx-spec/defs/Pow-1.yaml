doc: "\nPow takes input data (Tensor<T>) and exponent Tensor, and\nproduces one output\
  \ data (Tensor<T>) where the function `f(x) = x^exponent`,\nis applied to the data\
  \ tensor elementwise.\n\nIf necessary the right-hand-side argument will be broadcasted\
  \ to match the\nshape of left-hand-side argument. When broadcasting is specified,\
  \ the second\ntensor can either be of element size 1 (including a scalar tensor\
  \ and any\ntensor with rank equal to or smaller than the first tensor), or having\
  \ its\nshape as a contiguous subset of the first tensor's shape. The starting of\
  \ the\nmutually equal shape is specified by the argument \"axis\", and if it is\
  \ not set,\nsuffix matching is assumed. 1-dim expansion doesn't work yet.\n\nFor\
  \ example, the following tensor shapes are supported (with broadcast=1):\n\n  shape(A)\
  \ = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (,), i.e. B is a scalar tensor\n  shape(A) = (2, 3,\
  \ 4, 5), shape(B) = (1, 1), i.e. B is an 1-element tensor\n  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4,\
  \ 5), shape(B) = (5,)\n  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (4, 5)\n  shape(A)\
  \ = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (3, 4), with axis=1\n  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B)\
  \ = (2), with axis=0\n\nAttribute `broadcast=1` needs to be passed to enable broadcasting.\n"
