  description: Padding for the beginning and ending along each spatial axis, it can
    take any value greater than or equal to 0. The value represent the number of pixels
    added to the beginning and end part of the corresponding axis. `pads` format should
    be as follow [x1_begin, x2_begin...x1_end, x2_end,...], where xi_begin the number
    of pixels added at the beginning of axis `i` and xi_end, the number of pixels
    added at the end of axis `i`. This attribute cannot be used simultaneously with
    auto_pad attribute. If not present, the padding defaults to 0 along start and
    end of each spatial axis.

doc: "\nMaxUnpool essentially computes the partial inverse of the MaxPool op.\n The\
  \ input information to this op is typically the output information from a MaxPool\
  \ op. The first\n input tensor X is the tensor that needs to be unpooled, which\
  \ is typically the pooled tensor (first output)\n from MaxPool. The second input\
  \ tensor, I, contains the indices to the (locally maximal) elements corresponding\n\
  \ to the elements in the first input tensor X. Input tensor I is typically the second\
  \ output of the MaxPool op.\n The third (optional) input is a tensor that specifies\
  \ the output size of the unpooling operation.\n\nMaxUnpool is intended to do 'partial'\
  \ inverse of the MaxPool op. 'Partial' because all the non-maximal\n values from\
  \ the original input to MaxPool are set to zero in the output of the MaxUnpool op.\
  \ Pooling\n the result of an unpooling operation should give back the original input\
  \ to the unpooling op.\n\nMaxUnpool can produce the same output size for several\
  \ input sizes, which makes unpooling op ambiguous.\n The third input argument, output_size,\
  \ is meant to disambiguate the op and produce output tensor of\n known/predictable\
  \ size.\n\nIn addition to the inputs, MaxUnpool takes three attributes, namely kernel_shape,\
  \ strides, and pads,\n which define the exact unpooling op. The attributes typically\
  \ have the same values as the corresponding\n pooling op that the unpooling op is\
  \ trying to invert.\n"

- description: Input data tensor that has to be unpooled. This tensor is typically
    the first output of the MaxPool op.Dimensions for image case are (N x C x H x
    W), where N is the batch size, C is the number of channels, and H and W are the
    height and the width of the data. For non-image case, the dimensions are in the
    form of (N x C x D1 x D2 ... Dn), where N is the batch size. Optionally, if dimension
    denotation is in effect, the operation expects the input data tensor to arrive
    with the dimension denotation of [DATA_BATCH, DATA_CHANNEL, DATA_FEATURE, DATA_FEATURE
    ...].

- description: Input data tensor containing the indices corresponding to elements
    in the first input tensor X.This tensor is typically the second output of the
    MaxPool op.Dimensions must be the same as input tensor X. The indices are linear,
    i.e. computed considering the tensor as flattened 1-D tensor, assuming row-major
    storage. Also, the linear indices should not consider padding. So the values in
    indices are in the range [0, N x C x D1 x ... x Dn).
