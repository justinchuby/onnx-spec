  Given an input `X` and a flow-field `grid`, computes the output `Y` using `X` values
  and pixel locations from `grid`.

  Currently, only spatial (4-D) inputs are supported. For input `X` with shape (N,
  C, H, W) and `grid` with shape (N, H_out, W_out, 2),

  the output `Y` will have shape (N, C, H_out, W_out).


  The tensor `X` contains values at centers of square pixels in a H by W 2-dimensional
  image.

  The tensor `grid` describes normalized positions where the output `Y` is to be computed

  using a specified interpolation method (the mode) and a padding mode (for grid positions
  falling outside the 2-dimensional image).


  Elements in `grid[N, H_out, W_out]` are size-2 vectors specifying positions in the
  2-dimensional space of `X`.

  They are used to interpolate output values of `Y[N, C, H_out, W_out]`.


  The GridSample operator is often used in doing grid generator and sampler in the
  [Spatial Transformer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02025).
