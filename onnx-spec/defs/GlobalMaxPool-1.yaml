doc: "\n GlobalMaxPool consumes an input tensor X and applies max pooling across\n\
  \ the values in the same channel. This is equivalent to MaxPool with kernel size\n\
  \ equal to the spatial dimension of input tensor."
domain: ''
inputs:
- description: Input data tensor from the previous operator; dimensions for image
    case are (N x C x H x W), where N is the batch size, C is the number of channels,
    and H and W are the height and the width of the data. For non image case, the
    dimensions are in the form of (N x C x D1 x D2 ... Dn), where N is the batch size.

outputs:
- description: Output data tensor from pooling across the input tensor. The output
    tensor has the same rank as the input. The first two dimensions of output shape
    are the same as the input (N x C), while the other dimensions are all 1.
