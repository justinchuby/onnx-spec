  description: The axis on which to perform the DFT. By default this value is set
    to 1, which corresponds to the first dimension after the batch index. Negative
    value means counting dimensions from the back. Accepted range is $[-r, -2] \cup
    [0, r-2]$ where `r = rank(input)`. The last dimension is for representing complex
    numbers and thus is an invalid axis.

    this value is set to 0, which corresponds to false.

  description: If onesided is 1, only values for w in [0, 1, 2, ..., floor(n_fft/2)
    + 1] are returned because the real-to-complex Fourier transform satisfies the
    conjugate symmetry, i.e., X[m, w] = X[m, n_fft-w]*. Note if the input or window
    tensors are complex, then onesided output is not possible. Enabling onesided with
    real inputs performs a Real-valued fast Fourier transform (RFFT). When invoked
    with real or complex valued input, the default value is 0. Values can be 0 or
    1.
